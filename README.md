Free, open-source, and highly extensible Silkroad Online botting framework written in C\#. RSBot provides a lightweight clientless/client-attached environment designed for both regular users and developers who want to build custom automation modules.

Feel free to explore the codebase, create pull requests for improvements, or open issues for feature requests and bug reports.

## ✨ Key Features
